# Movies4Home
This is my react project for online movie watching and downloading

You can access it from https://drak138.github.io/Movies4Home/#/ for it to look good on 1080p zoom 150%

or sudo npm run dev and npm run nodemon 

change all instances of movies4home.onrender.com to your server localhost 

in Routes libraries .post invite route remove the sorten link creation tool and just create the long link with the local host as the main link not the github pages

also for testing purposes the authToken lasts 5 min. after that you will be logged out
